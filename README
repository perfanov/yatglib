ABI, API compatibility
source control
platform-agnostic design

Specific goal is making functionality along the lines of:
geometry (vector algebra etc)
image processing (resize, rotate, convert etc)
image encode/decode (jpeg etc)
trainer & learner systems (maybe a svm, genetic algo, etc)
GPU/SIMD/MIMD optimizations
